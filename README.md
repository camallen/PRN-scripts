# tPRN-scripts
Some scripts to help deploy projects in the Planetary Response Network

# Get started

Use docker / docker-compse to run the code and attach your input data to the container:
`TPRN_DATA_DIR=/your_tpnr_data_dir docker-compose run --rm tprn bash`

if you need to (re)build the container:
`docker-compose build tprn`
